# Simple ftp server

[![ftpserver](https://github.com/ivorob/scat/actions/workflows/cmake.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ivorob/scat/actions)

## What is it and what does it do?

It is a simple ftp server written in C++.
It comes without any warranties of any kind.

## How to use?

### Compile it

Compile it by using the `make all` command.
If all went well, an executable file named `ftpserver` should have been generated.

### Run the server

You can execute the executable generated in the compilation step by `./ftpserver`.

Command-line options are as follows:

ftpserver `server root directory, default=./` `port to listen on for incoming connections, default=4242` `telnet mode for use with telnet client, default=false`

To shut down, press Ctrl+C.

While it is running, a ftp client can connect to it.

### Usage reference

Available commands in the program that the client can issue and the running ftpserver will respond to:
